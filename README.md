Excolo Slider
============

A simple jquery sliding plugin, supporting responsive design and touch. 

Under development - see issues. 


Features:
- AutoPlay Slideshow
- Keyboard slide navigation
- Repeat when last slide is reached
- Play the slideshow backwards
- Auto adjust size initially and on browser resize, for responsive designs
- Touch enabled (limited to a few browsers)

Most of these features can be configured and turned off, when setting up the slider.
