Excolo Slider
============
A simple jquery sliding plugin, supporting responsive design, keyboard and touch navigation. 

Under development - see issues. 


Features:
- AutoPlay Slideshow
- Keyboard slide navigation
- Mouse slide navigation
- Prev/next button navigation
- Repeat when last slide is reached
- Play the slideshow backwards
- Auto adjust size initially and on browser resize, for responsive designs
- Touch enabled (limited to a few browsers)

Most of these features can be configured and turned off, when setting up the slider. 


Installation
============
Installation can be done using NuGet Package Manager, 
either by using the console, as seen below, or by searching for the package in the Visual Studio package explorer:
```

Then in the header of your website, you insert the references to jquery and the slider plugin:
```html
<script src="Scripts/jquery-1.9.1.min.js"></script>
